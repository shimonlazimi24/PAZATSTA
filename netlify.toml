# Next.js App Router on Netlify - requires @netlify/plugin-nextjs for API routes.
# The plugin transforms the Next.js build into Netlify Functions + Edge Functions.
# Do NOT set publish - the plugin manages output. If publish is set (or defaults
# to base dir), static assets /_next/static/* return 404 with text/html.
