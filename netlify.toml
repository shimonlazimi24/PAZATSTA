# Next.js App Router on Netlify - requires @netlify/plugin-nextjs for API routes.
# Without the plugin, publish = ".next" serves only static build output; API routes
# are not deployed as Netlify Functions and return 503.
# The plugin transforms the Next.js build into Netlify Functions + Edge Functions.
